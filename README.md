# Internship Projects at Guftugu Publications

This repository contains the projects I developed during my Generative AI internship at Guftugu Publications. The projects demonstrate various applications of generative AI technologies, including text-to-image generation, chatbots, model fine-tuning, and more.

## Projects Overview

1. **Text to Image Generator using Stable Diffusion**
   - Developed a model that generates images from textual descriptions using Stable Diffusion.
   - Utilizes advanced diffusion techniques to create high-quality visuals based on user input.

2. **Multiturn Chatbot using LangChain**
   - Created a conversational AI chatbot that can handle multi-turn dialogues.
   - Integrated LangChain for managing conversation context and enhancing user interactions.
   - The chatbot is capable of understanding and responding to user queries effectively.

3. **Fine-tuning GPT on Legal Documents**
   - Fine-tuned a GPT model on legal documents to improve its understanding and generation of legal text.
   - The model can assist with tasks such as drafting legal documents and answering legal questions.

4. **AI Cover Letter Generator**
   - Developed a tool that generates personalized cover letters based on user-provided resumes and job descriptions.
   - Utilizes a generative AI model to create professional and compelling cover letters tailored to specific job applications.

5. **Lip Sync Video Generator using Wav2Lip from Static Images**
   - Implemented a system that generates lip-synced videos from static images using the Wav2Lip model.
   - The project allows users to create engaging videos by animating facial expressions to match audio inputs.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Stable Diffusion for image generation
  - LangChain for chatbot development
  - Transformers for model fine-tuning
  - Wav2Lip for video generation
- **APIs**: Various APIs for model interaction and deployment
